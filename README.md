### Chrome OS

Mak<sup>native</sup> is a version of [Mak](https://mak.ink) designed specifically for **Chrome OS** with full system integration, offline mode and minimal resource requirements.

The application caches necessary resources at first launch for further offline work and supports all features of the web version. Because it's standalone application you don't need to open a browser and spend computer's resources to load it. Also you can control the application's permissions via the Chrome menu, as it fully integrates with the system.

Features like Drag'n'Drop, Files app context menu integration and quick text finding are supported by default.
